# Projects
A selection of projects I worked on over the years as part of my
studies, my consulting work and my work at RelationalAI.

# Development of the Rel language and KGMS
*01/2020 - now*

At [RelationalAI](https://www.relational.ai/) we are building a KGMS
(**K**nowlege **G**raph **M**anagement **S**ystem). A cloud native
relational database, completely built in
[Julia](https://julialang.org/), that allows clients to build
applications using the Rel programming language. As a computer
scientist, I contributed to the database protocol and server, language
features like exporting and loading data, the incremental metadata
system and the user-facing notebook product.

# Towards an instantaneous measure for information transfer of temporal networks 
*06/2019 - 12/2019*

In my master thesis at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) we
developed a novel measure for information transfer in temporal
networks that can be incrementally computed and maintained. We
analyzed its behavior, robustness and tractability with real-world
collaborative networks.

# Indoor data acquisition for air quality
*06/2019 - 06/2020*

In a client project we developed a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
application for an ARM architecture that uses a set of sensors to
monitor air quality. It consist of an array of sensors measuring
multiple indicators in a regular interval.

# Incremental functional aggregate queries
*01/2019 - 04/2019*

Implementing the core aspects of Functional Aggregate Queries (FAQ)
inside Differential Dataflow using worst case optimal joins and
arbitrary semi-ring aggregates. More information is in the related
[post](/pages/posts/2019-07-06-Incremental-Functional-Aggregate-Queries/index.html).

# Cohort analytics service for user engagement
*07/2018 - 11/2018*

Using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/),
[Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) and
[VegaLite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) we built an analytics
service showing the engagement of users in different cohorts. See this
[post](/pages/posts/2018-11-25-reactive-datalog-with-vega/index.html)
for inspiration.

# Review of the usability, accuracy and costs of an ultrasonic-based airflow measurement method
*04/2017 - 06/2017*

I developed a prototype to measure airflow through a system of
valves. We used a microcontroller and a time-of-flight algorithm to
infer the properties of the flow.

# Simulation of anti-helium production from interactions of cosmic-rays with interstellar matter
*03/2016 - 06/2016*

In my bachelor thesis at [RWTH
Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) we used
[pythia](https://pythia.org/) to generate proton-proton collision that
produce anti-helium via a coalescence model. The simulated flux was
compared to the sensitivity of the AMS particle detector.
