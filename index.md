# About

Currently, I work as a computer scientist for
[RelationalAI](https://relational.ai) and formerly, I worked as a
software consultant for Clockworks. 

I studied physics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) focusing on
computational quantum physics, quantum information theory and complex
systems.

I am interested in functional-relational programming,
neuroinformatics, and quantum information theory. In my free time I
listen to vinyls, make music or dabble in analog photography.

I worked professionally with Rust, Clojure, Julia and JavaScript, and
a little C and Python here and there.

You can reach me over on [github](https://github.com/eoxxs) or

Some open-source projects I contributed to:

- [declarative dataflow](https://github.com/comnik/declarative-dataflow)
- [clj-3df](https://github.com/sixthnormal/clj-3df)
- [differential dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow)
