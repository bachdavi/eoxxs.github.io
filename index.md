# About

Currently, I work as a computer scientist for
[RelationalAI](https://relational.ai), and formerly, I worked as a
software consultant for Clockworks.

I studied physics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), focusing
on computational quantum physics, quantum information theory and
complex systems.

I am interested in functional-relational programming,
neuroinformatics, and quantum information theory. In my free time I
listen to records, make music, go rock climbing, or dabble in analog
photography.

I worked professionally with Rust, Clojure, Julia, and JavaScript.

You can reach me over on [github](https://github.com/bachdavi) or

Some open-source projects I contributed to:

- [declarative dataflow](https://github.com/comnik/declarative-dataflow)
- [clj-3df](https://github.com/sixthnormal/clj-3df)
- [differential dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow)
