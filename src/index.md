# About

I am a computer scientist at [RelationalAI](https://relational.ai) and
a physicist from ETH Zurich, keen to uncover deep mysteries of our
universe â€” or something like that.

I formerly worked as a software consultant at [Clockworks](http://clockworks.io).

I am interested in functional-relational programming, databases, and
quantum information theory. My programming languages of choice are
Rust, Clojure, and Julia.

You can reach me over on [github](https://github.com/eoxxs) or
[twitter](https://twitter.com/bachdavi).

Related projects I've been working on:

- [declarative dataflow](https://github.com/comnik/declarative-dataflow)
- [clj-3df](https://github.com/sixthnormal/clj-3df)
- [differential dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow)

Sometimes I write about them.
